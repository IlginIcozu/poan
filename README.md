## Description of the Work

Poan is an audio reactive work which has a minimalistic approach. 



Since Poan is an audio reactive work, a new piece can be composed and replaced with the current one.

Simply copy your composition to the folder and replace the name of the existing file. For example; 

```javascript
function preload(){
  file1 = loadSound("den4.mp3");  /// Change den4.mp3 to your file name and type.
}
```
