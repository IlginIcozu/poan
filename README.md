## Description of the Work

Poan is an audio-reactive work. Recursive circles, animated waveforms (generated by fft analysis) and a grayscale color palatte are used to form a minimalistic feel.

Since Poan is an audio-reactive work, a new piece could be composed and replaced with the current one. Simply copy your composition to the folder and replace the name of the existing file. For example; 

```javascript
function preload(){
  file1 = loadSound("den4.mp3");  /// Change den4.mp3 to your file name and type.
}
```
